            > through several mediums i have tried to eradicate my mental space of this pervasive demon. through perils, arts, any medium really i feel a deep, strange displacement from the world. i sit completely stoicly on public transit, staring directly ahead in an anonymous gaze. i watch the lights, the trees, and i try not to focus on the other people on their phones occassionally looking at me like i'm psychotic for not also staring at a cellular device. i'm not really quite sure what's real anymore & i sure as hell can't wrap my hell around all of this. it feels as if i am moving in one direction, unbridled by the shit flung in my direction. i feel invincible yet shackled. it's certainly better than being actually shackled.<br><br>
            > when bill gates jumped over the chair, it's often looked at as this monumental feat of man. this little nerd, crunched up in his cubicle worked his ass off to create the ultimate super-computer. they all come from "nowhere", and visions of a little geek in a musty garage come to mind. mark zuckerberg feeding his horny addictions in a dorm room. "we will compare all of the girls' faces at our college" he said, and thus created a techno-dystopian superpower nightmare capable of extracting our data in ever-increasingly fast & dark ways. it's so incredibly smart that elon musk sat in a room on reddit whilst the engineers made the rocket that landed on the pad in the ocean that everyone says he coded himself in c# or something. "elon musk did that", it is the marvel of this mythical man & his big computer brain! he did this! it's not that he used a bunch of capital extracted from the backs of his pampered life to horde developers, capitalist innovators, marketing specialists, logistics departments, engineers & harvard alumns! no! no! it must be the genius, the intellect of the man with a bachelor's degree in physics. i hold a bachelor's degree in computer science & i can barely describe to you a functioning data structure.<br><br>
            > a lot of talk is held about the dichotomy of the proletariat & the bourgeoisie: a massive divide in class & power. this is certainly so. bill and his $200,000/yr croissant shop in new york city is well off & he'd certainly do everything he could to maintain that level of power. he's the bourgeoisie, an owner, a capitalist & an enemy of class struggle, and thusly the enemy of the proletariat. but it is not this bourgeoisie that even begins to affect our day-to-day. that is a different level of capitalist, a different level of power, a different, higher level of evil entirely. that is a super-bourgeoisie with vastly higher amounts of wealth, and thusly the power to control the masses. many of these super-bourgeoisie, these super wealthy, have power that bill and his croissant shop could only dream of. many of these super-bourgeoisie find themselves in positions of techno-dystopian power. a power to cull, shape, and mold society to its whim. a rate of technology so fast & weld together that an average person can't comprehend its evils.<br><br>
            > these large swaths of data: collected, extracted & recycled to create perfect experiences tailored to each person's brain. this experience is better & faster at giving us what we want than even our conscious dialogue is capable of. it almost feels as if it reacts faster than our own neural responses to stimuli (that guide some of us day-to-day).<br><br>
            > computing is beautiful. computing has come a long way, in its power, but it isn't free. it isn't even a democratic landscape in which to burrow in. it's a centralized monopoly: the web, technology, computing & software. the large majority of these sectors are fueled entirely by the super-bourgeoisie.

            <b>on computing:</b>
            <p>> computing is currently very free for the people in a general sense, but it could be much more free. most people don't tend to think about their machines idealogically, but the machines in which many desktop users run are built for-profit in closed-source capitalistic structures. as of 2024, most desktop computers run windows or macos as their operating system, but many do not know that free and open-source alternatives exist, built and powered by the people for the people: linux. in many parts, of the world, linux is taught in schools. on websites like github, it is very easy to find free, open-source linux applications or projects that make windows or macos applications obsolete. the technology and passion exists to prop up very powerful applications, operating systems and software that maintain a free, open-source structure. an ideal world for all digital peoples would be a world where the industry standard for all types of computing is operated under gnu/linux running free, open-source software. global server operating system market share already has linux above 62%. most people around the world use android as their smart phone operating system of choice. every year, daily driver desktop statistics show linux growing. in september of 2023, linux held 3.02% of the desktop operating system market share worldwide. in july 2024, it holds 4.4% of the global market share. gaming has recently made strides with the advent of the steam deck. according to protondb, a resource for linux gaming compatibality ran by the people, a majority of games are playable. as of august 8th, 2024, 78% of the top 1000 most popular steam games are playable, with most of the "unplayable" games coming down to corporate an ideal world sees the end of corporations like microsoft or apple: capitalistic machines grinding technology to a halt by forcing the dreaded paid operating system down the throats of the people. that being said, there still needs to be work to do in the gnu/linux front. sometimes, corporate, paid applications on windows provide closed-source solutions that are simply unparalleled. ideally, as more and more users switch to linux, these new users can help contribute to an ecosystem of applications and operating systems that truly dismantle the capitalist core of desktop and general computing. 
            <br><br>
                > computing is also very wasteful. as technologies develop, more and more power is needed to keep devices running and advancing. it is expected, with the advent of generative artificial intelligence, that the data-center share of electricity consumption in the united states could triple 2022's numbers by 2030. computers were intially meant to solve specific problems, but now they are meant to do everything possible. it's expected of your phone, or even your microwave to do everything. i've heard jokes about playing minecraft in your tesla car. it's important for all people to think about how we can make computing more sustainable, purposeful, and less wasteful.
            <br><br>
                > most people in the world have access to the internet, an ever-expanding network that allows us to connect online. most would perhaps think that the internet is free and great for peoples at first glance, but it's actually quite dystopian. the problem of the internet lies in the way web standards have shifted towards monopoly and centralization at such lightning speeds. this centralization isn't centered around people or democracy or anything nice like that. this centralization is powered by a handful of large corporations that have no reason to cater to the common person. in 2019, visualcapitalist.com noted that 41.5% of the public cloud market is ran on amazon web services, with another 29.4% powered by microsoft azure. when thinking about which websites to visit, whether on your computer, your phone, or your blender, most think of only a handful. maybe jane uses twitter, reddit & tumblr. maybe jack uses amazon to shop, and browses tiktok late at night to laugh. the web used to be fairly decentralized, consisting of a plethora of servers running hobbyist websites or niche topic forums. now, you are forced into large congregations (twitter as an example), force-fed content algorithmically until your stomach turns blue. there isn't much power to the user. in fact, it feels as if power & customization are stripped away at the user-level with every passing day. it used to be that you could create all of the html & css yourself on most website profiles. it's fun to think about a web that could be run more for the people's sake, rather than to seek profit via the deliverance of advertisements and algorithmic routines. the internet also has many ethical pitfalls. it would be interesting to imagine an internet with greater regulations set in place to thwart data-collection, protect user privacy, and ban for-profit practice. imagine a world where social media users need to be 18 to post. imagine a world where, in the united states, you wouldn't just be able to search someone's name and find all of their information readily available, sold. in the united states, the government is often unconcerned with these matters, and perhaps it's no wonder when considering the average age of an american congress-person. in 2021, half of the united states senate was 65 years or older. the 117th united states congress was the oldest it had been in decades. it's no surprise that old, crotchety bastards are unconcerned with the ethical issues in computing and internet practice. for younger people, however, the internet is an important tool, and perhaps we don't yet understand the full consequences of this lack of regulation.
            <br><br>
                > the goal of any capitalist structure is to provide profit to the capitalist owner. this concept extends to a digital product as well, whether it be a website or application. to sell these digital products, you might need to market your online product. thus, you might need a data farm to collect ages, hair colors, heights, breast sizes, condiment preferences and favorite music albums. thus, you might get reccommended a new diaper brand when you open your amazon application because you've had a baby recently. to get people to use a capitalist-born application, it often needs to be predatory. corporations aren't concerned with making an application that actually satisfies the user's full scope of ambitions. it often just has to run, and sometimes it's not even good at doing that. if the only goal is to derive profit, a website or an application will do the bare minimum to satisfy the user. it will instead trap the user in its algorithm, make the user angered by showing it posts it knows the user won't like, giving the user advertisements based on its perceptions, and hiding this all behind a concealed layer in a closed-source context. the beauty of open-source is that you can view this code, and programmers are certainly able to notice when the code is acting nefariously, quite quickly in fact. in a societal structure where the government and the people worked for the people, an internet wouldn't spy on the user, an application wouldn't show you an advertisement for colgate after a candy-eating binge, and a video game certainly wouldn't install at the kernel level. it is practices like these which any computer user should look to conquer and overcome. a world does exist where all software and computers are open-source and safe for all users.
