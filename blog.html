                > artistically, it can be very satisfying to limit yourself to a
                small set of tools.<br>modernity brings forth many digital and
                technical inventions that increase productivity, but sometimes
                that can feel very overwhelming creatively.<br>i have always found
                pleasure in stripping back layers and going back to the basics.<br>
                instead of drawing on a computer with infinite undo's, dozens of
                layers, and unlimited colors, try returning to a piece of paper
                and a pencil.<br>you'd be surprised how much creativity you can
                squeeze out of such few resources.
