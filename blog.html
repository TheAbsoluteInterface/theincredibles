            <p>
                artistically, it can be very satisfying to limit yourself to a
                small set of tools. modernity brings forth many digital and
                technical inventions that increase productivity, but sometimes
                that can feel very overwhelming creatively. i have always found
                pleasure in stripping back layers and going back to the basics.
                instead of drawing on a computer with infinite undo's, dozens of
                layers, and unlimited colors, try returning to a piece of paper
                and a pencil. you'd be surprised how much creativity you can
                squeeze out of such few resources.
