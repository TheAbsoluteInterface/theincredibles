            <p>> reading "why zebras don't get ulcers". good read so far. reading psychology is like eating candy.<br>
            anyone who can make talking about the parasympathetic nervous system funny should be heralded a little bit.<br><br>
            > anyway, i wanted to touch base on my feelings & thoughts about my industry:<br>
            i kind of hate it!<br><br>
            > now, i benefit from it greatly & i love many aspects of my job.<br>
            creating art, music & maintaining my website gives me great joy!<br>
            in fact, sometimes on an off day i find myself doing something stupid like spending 8 hours creating a forum.<br>
            however, there are many aspects of this industry that i certainly don't enjoy:<br> <br>
            1. for starters, i think social media is genuinely revolting. it's really hard, but i'm trying to exit it.<br>
            i find that when i read twitter, my cortisol levels rise. so, i've quit twitter!<br>
            i think people that use twitter often probably develop hypertension & i'd love to see some eventual research on that if twitter outlasts this current decade.<br>
                it is already fact that twitter feeds you stuff you don't want to see algorithmically to raise engagement (aka something that pisses you off).<br><br>
            2. when i read the sleep deprived comments, i am genuinely baffled at the vitriol spread, not only in the form of transphobia towards me, but in<br>the form of parasocial over-analyzation & judgment towards my colleagues & i. not worth reading, imo.<br>
            i also don't really like the give-and-take of a livestream anymore. it just doesn't feel good.<br><br>
            3. the more time i spend outside, the more i feel alive.<br><br>
            you know the great tweet by juniper about 3 corporations in a trenchcoat?<br>
            well, the modern web is actually 3 social medias in a trenchcoat. <br>(facebook, twitter & anything google or amazonian [yt/twitch])
            <br><br>
            using social media less & operating less within the confines of these anonymized gatherings (which is akin to road rage on a highway) has vastly improved my well-being.<br><br>
            > i've grown to hate making an aztrosist video. whenever i drop the character and act more like myself, it backfires.<br> in fact, i once posted myself eating orange slices and received hundreds of transphobic comments. it sort of begs the question: why?<br>
            i didn't even mention being trans, being queer or anything in that video. i ate orange slices. that was it. it's interesting, really.<br>
            in fact, i barely talk about these sorts of things at all online & yet still receive commentary about how i make everything about my identity.<br>
            i'm actually really comfortable with my identity, maybe they're uncomfortable with theirs?<br><br>
            regardless, why operate within these confines if they do not give me happiness? so, i've begun seeking other methods of obtaining joy. & i'm enjoying that journey.

            <br>i'm not someone who ascribes mbti to myself like a harpoon. i think it's interesting & fun mostly.<br>
            honestly, i think its a tired dispute to go "well mbti doesn't matter!" yeah, no shit. it's just putting humans into 16 different buckets.<br>
            i am vastly different than a million other INFJ's. but in some ways i'm alike! i think that's interesting to ponder for 15 minutes on a coffee break.<br>alas:</p>

            <p>> i listened to my 1000th album today. feels kinda cool.<br>
            i have been listening to full albums for a pretty long time. it feels kinda cool to catalog the 1000th one.<br>
            > for reference, i track every album i listen to on <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/~aztrosist">[rateyourmusic]</a>. it's a rad site for finding new stuff & cataloguing.<br>
            > my 1000th album was some breakcore album i found in the algorithm.<br>i listened to it in its entirety in the shower. "goreshit - goretrance 9" was the title. it was okay.<br>

            <p>> it's hard to picture a happier day than today. i found my favorite bug in the wild.<br>my favorite bug is the periodical cicada (specifically magicicada septendecim)<br>& they've been popping up alongside brood 19 (which only lines up every 221 years).<br>
                i hung out with them. i made a video about it <a href="https://youtu.be/aDEXRu7eVAU">[here]</a>, but i'll post a picture for you as well:<br>
