                    <p>> personally, i am combining both the original television show (which stands on its own i might add) with the end of evangelion movie. reason being: if you've finished the tv show, you might as well watch the movie too... (and the rebuilds, but let's not get too overwhelming with our pro-nge propaganda)<br><br>
                    > evangelion is a great piece of pyschological fiction. it delves deep into the psyche of the mind under stress. honestly, watch this alongside a reading of "why zebras don't get ulcers" by robert sapolsky and your entire frontal cortex will expand.<br><br>
                    > i recently watched macross plus (the movie edit) & noticed a lot of proto-nge stuff, from translucent white ghostly spectacles like rei to character design & minor details. obviously, there is gunbuster & nadia, anime which hideaki anno directed prior to neon genesis evangelion which bare much resemblance. you have animators working on this thing that ended up founding entire companies and franchises of their own: notably hiroyuki imaishi who did key animation for neon genesis evangelion. he went on to direct panty & stocking, gurren laggan, kill la kill, cyberpunk: edgerunners, and so on... this thing is packed full of detail & life. it is an explosion of hideaki anno's stressed mind, and it feels very personal. every character is flawed, suffering & contentious. this anime defines entire generations of those it inspired, which is shown in the later works of gainax, trigger & studio khara.<br><br>
                    > it is an important watch for any fan of art & animation. personally, i do not think there is a better sequence of animation in any piece of media than the scene where asuka fights the mass production evangelions in the neon genesis evangelion: end of evangelion movie. that scene inspires me beyond belief... from the stark red blood against the blue background to the ominous vulture presence of the mass production evas sweeping in like seagulls in a parking lot eating crumbs. in that scene, i believe it showcases the large scale & movement of a mecha that large & i have not scene that sort of weight conveyed in animation so flawlessly anywhere else. yoshiyuki sadamoto is very responsible for the iconic aesthetic & character design, but the mechanical specialities of anno & co. really shine through the mecha and nerv user interface design. the blend of mecha & flesh is also very enticing. the use of fonts, colors & mechanical design elevate this show to an inspired quality. this very website is inspired by this anime's design. furthermore, the soundtrack ranges from peculiar/otherworldly to depressing/haunting. sometimes, as the show progresses, it only gets more haunting. the sense of danger from each impending angel sends the cast & viewer into psychological collapse.<br><br></p>
